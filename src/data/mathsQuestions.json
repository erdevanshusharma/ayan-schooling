    "question": "Ayan has 5 apples. He gives 2 to his friend and gets 3 more from his mom. How many apples does Ayan have now?",
    "options": ["4 apples", "6 apples", "7 apples", "8 apples"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Addition and Subtraction",
    "explanation": "Let's solve this step by step:\n1. Ayan starts with 5 apples\n2. He gives away 2 apples: 5 - 2 = 3 apples\n3. He gets 3 more apples: 3 + 3 = 6 apples\nSo, Ayan ends up with 6 apples!"

    "options": ["9", "10", "11", "12"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Number Patterns",
    "explanation": "This is a counting by 2s pattern. Each number is 2 more than the previous one:\n2 + 2 = 4\n4 + 2 = 6\n6 + 2 = 8\nSo, the next number would be 8 + 2 = 10!"

    "question": "If a triangle has 3 sides and a square has 4 sides, how many sides does a hexagon have?",
    "options": ["5", "6", "7", "8"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Geometry - Shapes",
    "explanation": "A hexagon is a shape with 6 sides. The word 'hex' means six in Greek. You can remember this by thinking of other words that start with 'hex', like 'hexapod' (an insect with 6 legs)!"

    "question": "What is 7 x 3?",
    "options": ["18", "21", "24", "27"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Multiplication",
    "explanation": "Let's think of this as adding 7 three times:\n7 + 7 + 7 = 21\nOr we can count by 7s three times:\n7, 14, 21\nSo, 7 x 3 = 21"

    "question": "If you have 15 candies and want to share them equally among 3 friends, how many candies will each friend get?",
    "options": ["3", "4", "5", "6"],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "concept": "Division",
    "explanation": "To solve this, we need to divide 15 by 3:\n15 ÷ 3 = 5\nWe can check this by multiplying:\n5 x 3 = 15\nSo, each friend will get 5 candies."

    "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "1/3", "1/5"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Fractions",
    "explanation": "1/2 is the largest fraction here. It means 'one out of two parts' or 'half'. If you divide a pizza into two parts and take one, you'd have more pizza than if you divided it into 3, 4, or 5 parts and took one."

    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Time",
    "explanation": "Let's count 30 minutes from 2:45 PM:\n15 minutes takes us to 3:00 PM\nAnother 15 minutes takes us to 3:15 PM\nSo, 30 minutes after 2:45 PM is 3:15 PM"

    "question": "If a rectangle has a length of 8 cm and a width of 5 cm, what is its perimeter?",
    "options": ["13 cm", "26 cm", "40 cm", "30 cm"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Perimeter",
    "explanation": "The perimeter of a rectangle is the distance around it. We can calculate it by adding all sides:\nPerimeter = 2 × (length + width)\nPerimeter = 2 × (8 cm + 5 cm)\nPerimeter = 2 × 13 cm = 26 cm"

  {
    "question": "What is the missing number in this equation: 15 + __ = 23?",
    "options": ["7", "8", "9", "10"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "concept": "Addition and Subtraction",
    "explanation": "To find the missing number, we can subtract:\n23 - 15 = 8\nWe can check this:\n15 + 8 = 23\nSo, the missing number is 8."
