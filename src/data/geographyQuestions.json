    "question": "Where can you find the largest rainforest in the world?",
    "options": ["Africa", "South America", "Asia", "Australia"],
    "correctAnswer": 1,
    "location": "Amazon Rainforest",
    "explanation": "The largest rainforest in the world is the Amazon Rainforest, located primarily in South America. It covers about 5.5 million square kilometers, which is about 900 times bigger than San Jose, California! The Amazon is so huge that if it were a country, it would be the 9th largest in the world. \n\nAyan, did you know that the Amazon Rainforest is about 55 million years old? That's more than 9 million times older than you! It's home to millions of plant and animal species, including some that haven't even been discovered yet. \n\nThe Amazon River, which runs through the rainforest, is about 6,400 km long. That's like travelling from San Jose to New York City and back... twice! The river is so wide at some points that you can't see the other side.\n\nThe Amazon Rainforest is often called the 'lungs of the Earth' because it produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. That means that one in every five breaths you take comes from the Amazon! Isn't that amazing, Ayan?"

    "question": "Which of these is NOT one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World?",
    "options": [
      "The Great Pyramid of Giza",
      "The Hanging Gardens of Babylon",
      "The Taj Mahal",
      "The Statue of Zeus at Olympia"
    ],
    "correctAnswer": 2,
    "location": "Taj Mahal, India",
    "explanation": "The Taj Mahal, while incredibly beautiful, is not one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It's actually part of the New Seven Wonders of the World! \n\nAyan, the Taj Mahal was built about 400 years ago, which is about 67 times older than you are now! It's located in Agra, India, which is about 12,900 km from San Jose - that's like flying around the entire Earth one and a half times!\n\nThe Seven Wonders of the Ancient World were:\n1. The Great Pyramid of Giza (still standing today!)\n2. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon\n3. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus\n4. The Statue of Zeus at Olympia\n5. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus\n6. The Colossus of Rhodes\n7. The Lighthouse of Alexandria\n\nMost of these were built more than 2,000 years ago - that's more than 330 times older than you, Ayan! Sadly, only the Great Pyramid of Giza still exists today. \n\nThe Taj Mahal, on the other hand, is a more recent wonder. It was built as a beautiful tomb for an emperor's wife. It's made of white marble that seems to change color depending on the sunlight. Isn't it fascinating how people from different times and places have created such amazing buildings?"
